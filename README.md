# Web-Coursework-Group-Project.
This is the web page created by us for our web development coursework.
Welcome to our web development group project! Our team has come together to create an exciting and innovative website that will meet the needs of our clients and users. 
Our project will involve designing and developing a dynamic website that is visually appealing, user-friendly, and functional.Throughout this project, we will work together to plan, design, develop, test, and deploy the website. We will use modern web development tools and frameworks to ensure that the website is responsive, fast, and secure. We will also prioritize user feedback and incorporate it into our development process to ensure that the final product meets the needs and expectations of our users.
