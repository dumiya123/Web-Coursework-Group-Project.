Though primarily a classical instrument, it has adapted to other genres and was a foundational instrument for the 1970s rock group Jethro Tull.<br>The flute is a musical instrument that belongs to the family of woodwind instruments. It is a tube-shaped instrument made of wood, metal, or plastic, with holes along its length that are covered and uncovered by the fingers to produce different notes.

Today, the most common type of flute is the Western concert flute, which is often played in orchestras and bands. It is a versatile instrument that can produce a wide range of notes, from high and bright to low and mellow, and is often used in a variety of musical genres, including classical, jazz, and folk music.</p><hr>
